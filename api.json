      "summary": "Theory that Earth is hollow with openings at the poles and contains internal civilizations. Historical scientific speculation (17th-19th century) has been definitively disproven by seismology, which reveals Earth's internal structure: crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.",
      "full": "The Hollow Earth theory proposes that Earth is hollow with openings at the North and South poles, potentially containing an inner sun and advanced civilizations such as the legendary Agartha or Shambhala. The concept appeared in 17th-19th century scientific speculation by figures like Edmond Halley, Leonhard Euler, and John Cleves Symmes Jr., who proposed polar expeditions to prove the theory. The idea was popularized by fiction (Jules Verne's 'Journey to the Center of the Earth') and later incorporated into conspiracy theories, including unverified claims of Nazi interest and misquotations of Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expeditions. Modern seismology has definitively disproven a hollow interior, revealing Earth's layered structure (crust, mantle, outer core, inner core). Earth's measured mass and density require a dense interior. The theory is scientifically impossible and has been thoroughly debunked."
